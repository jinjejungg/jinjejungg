        <h1>NOT A LAMBORGHINI</h1>
        <p>
            This fabrication project was one that I had created after 5 weeks of learning Blender and Fusion starting with zero experience. As I have always found fascination with the intricacies of car design, I wanted to bestow on myself just how complicated and technical it would get. Taking on the challenge to replicate a Lamborghini Contauch from scratch, I decided to utilize the skills I had learned in Fusion and Illustrator to physicalize it from pictures I found online, and my terrible sketches I had so masterfully composed on Microsoft Paint. I specifically wanted a car with a lot of different degree angles and a more boxy composure, which I found the Contauch to fit both criteria. It ended up looking much more like a Pinewood Derby car that my dad and I would create when I was a cub scout. But hey, no kit this time! After I had fabricated each individual part to be laser cut on Fusion, I then exported all parts into Adobe Illustrator, where I then was able to add detailing on the car, such as the logo and headlights for more recognizability. As I thoroughly enjoyed wooden press kits as a child, I enjoyed the creation of this project thoroughly, and would like to revisit similar ideas with more technicality.

<h1>N64 DONKEY KONG DANCE PARTY</h1>
<p>
    Learning Ableton and music production was one of the hardest challenges I have ever faced in my life. Thinking it would be a breeze to make a tune, my aspirations to become a world-renounced producer were crushed in mere seconds. Trying to sample and chop music like my favorite artists, creating a catchy drum loop, I could not achieve it for the life of me. But then, I discovered the conga drum, and a specific sine wave that reminded me of retro arcade games I would play by convenience stores in Korea. Layer by layer,  day by day, I was able to create this 3-minute long track that I would like to imagine Donkey Kong dancing his heart out to while throwing barrels. The last minute of the song represents the end of the party, one of such sadness and despair as Donkey Kong can no longer throw barrels and dance to the groove. This track took me much longer than expected to make, and it was in zero direction of where I wanted it to be when I first began production. However, I am proud of a somewhat coherent track that I had made, and my 11 plays on SoundCloud it has now racked up.

<h1>
    THE END OF AI
</h1>
<p>
    Not quite literally the end of artificial intelligence, but Ascension Industry, which was a brand that my friend and I had been working on for the past five years. Both with a great interest in design and Pokémon, we specialized in the creation of Pokémon themed bracelets, rings, and pendants. For years, it was a success, and I was able to find great enjoyment in the process. In 2024, we found the most growth and success with our products, and garnered more attention than ever before. In the process of planning our 4-year anniversary pop-up store in Los Angeles, we were hit with a cease and desist from Pokémon - the attention we had gotten over the year was a double edged sword indeed. We had then decided to treat our event more like a farewell event rather than a celebration of new products - which we now had a lot of, but could not sell in fear of a lawsuit. However, the event was successful, many fans partook in the event, and both of us think of it as very memorable to this day. The four year run was a success - ended much shorter than we had anticipated - but still a great learning curve for the both of us. This 30-second video was one that I had much fulfillment in making.
