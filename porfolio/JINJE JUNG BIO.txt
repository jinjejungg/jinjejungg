JINJE JUNG BIO

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this .txt file. My name is Jinje Jung, a current fourth year student at University of California, Santa Barbara, majoring in economics and accounting, with a minor in media arts and design. Quite the contrast. I have always had great interest in art, specifically movies, and design. It began when my friend and I started to design our own rings to sell to others, and with this, I found myself to greatly enjoying the process of planning a design, materializing it, and further improving on technical skills required to physicalize our ideas. I do not discriminate against any art forms - even the contemporary art nowadays that seems to get much disfavored opinions, but I do find great interest in works with attention to great detail - ranging from works such as Stanley Kubrick or Park Chan-Wook's films to the intricacies of Seurat's paintings. Taking inspiration from the artworks I favor, I wish to create and design ideas in which I myself would enjoy creating, and using as tabletop decoration. I also believe that art takes on an infinite array of forms, from the timeless, forever-useful design of the monobloc chair to Beirendonck's fashion pieces, and it is up to the viewer to interpret as is, and form an opinion of taste.
