N64 DONKEY KONG DANCE PARTY -

Learning Ableton and music production was one of the hardest challenges I have ever faced in my life. Thinking it would be a breeze to make a tune, my aspirations to become a world-renounced producer were crushed in mere seconds. Trying to sample and chop music like my favorite artists, creating a catchy drum loop, I could not achieve it for the life of me. But then, I discovered the conga drum, and a specific sine wave that reminded me of retro arcade games I would play by convenience stores in Korea. Layer by layer,  day by day, I was able to create this 3-minute long track that I would like to imagine Donkey Kong dancing his heart out to while throwing barrels. The last minute of the song represents the end of the party, one of such sadness and despair as Donkey Kong can no longer throw barrels and dance to the groove. This track took me much longer than expected to make, and it was in zero direction of where I wanted it to be when I first began production. However, I am proud of a somewhat coherent track that I had made, and my 11 plays on SoundCloud it has now racked up.
