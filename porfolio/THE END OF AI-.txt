THE END OF AI-

Not quite literally the end of artificial intelligence, but Ascension Industry, which was a brand that my friend and I had been working on for the past five years. Both with a great interest in design and Pokémon, we specialized in the creation of Pokémon themed bracelets, rings, and pendants. For years, it was a success, and I was able to find great enjoyment in the process. In 2024, we found the most growth and success with our products, and garnered more attention than ever before. In the process of planning our 4-year anniversary pop-up store in Los Angeles, we were hit with a cease and desist from Pokémon - the attention we had gotten over the year was a double edged sword indeed. We had then decided to treat our event more like a farewell event rather than a celebration of new products - which we now had a lot of, but could not sell in fear of a lawsuit. However, the event was successful, many fans partook in the event, and both of us think of it as very memorable to this day. The four year run was a success - ended much shorter than we had anticipated - but still a great learning curve for the both of us. This 30-second video was one that I had much fulfillment in making.
